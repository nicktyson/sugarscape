This project is an implementation of a subset of an agent-based social simulation model called Sugarscape.  Sugarscape was presented in Growing Artificial Societies, a book written by two social science researchers.  My implementation includes the rules governing  resource growth, agent movement, reproduction, and cultural transmission.  These rules are enough to cause emergent patterns including an environmental carrying capacity, seasonal migration, evolution, and the formation of distinct cultural groups.
